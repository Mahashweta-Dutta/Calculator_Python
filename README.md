# Calculator_Python
# 🧮 Python Calculator

This is a basic calculator project built using **Python**, developed as **Task 1** of my internship at **Pinnacle Lab**. The calculator supports fundamental arithmetic operations and serves as a great starting point for beginners to understand core Python concepts.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Addition  
- ✅ Subtraction  
- ✅ Multiplication  
- ✅ Division  
- ✅ Error handling (e.g., division by zero)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- Core concepts: `functions`, `conditionals`, `loops`, and `input/output`

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `.py` file.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
python calculatorProject_Python.py

📚 Learning Outcome
Through this task, I enhanced my understanding of:

Writing clean and reusable code in Python

Handling user input and validations

Implementing logic for a command-line tool

Debugging and improving code readability

🏁 Future Improvements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt

Include more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, exponent)

Add a history or memory feature

🙌 Acknowledgment
This project is part of my internship at Pinnacle Lab.
Grateful for the opportunity to learn and build hands-on Python applications.

Feel free to fork the project or suggest improvements!
